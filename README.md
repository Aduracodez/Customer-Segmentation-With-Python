# Customer Segmentation Analysis using K-means Algorithm


## Overview
Welcome to my GitHub profile! This repository showcases my project on Customer Segmentation Analysis using the K-means algorithm. The project aims to segment customers based on their behavior and characteristics, helping businesses gain valuable insights into their customer base and make data-driven decisions.

By utilizing machine learning techniques and the popular K-means clustering algorithm, this project provides a powerful tool for customer segmentation. The results are visualized to aid in the interpretation of the findings and facilitate effective marketing strategies.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: The project includes data preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset for clustering analysis.
K-means Algorithm: It applies the K-means algorithm to cluster customers into distinct groups based on their attributes, enabling businesses to identify different customer segments.
Evaluation Metrics: The project incorporates evaluation metrics such as silhouette score, within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), or other relevant metrics to assess the quality of the clustering results.
Visualization: It provides visualizations, such as scatter plots, that illustrate the customer segmentation and assist in interpreting the results effectively.
# Installation
